# ASCENDO.LOL · Founder Profiles

A curated static GitHub Pages site. There are no public accounts or profile-creation forms.

## Pages

- `/`: the real Ascendo logo, Client 26.3 Discord link, founder cards, and decorative floating phrases on black.
- `/internalcheats/`: InternalCheats; Discord `internalcheats`; Minecraft IGN `InternalCheat`.
- `/k3rlsen/`: k3rlsen; TikTok `@ferenckop`; Instagram `@_shewantss.csxngi`; Discord `27ia`.
- `/nagyorru/`: compatibility redirect to `/internalcheats/`, with a visible fallback link.

Profiles open immediately. The existing video attempts playback with audio, falls back to muted playback when required by the browser, and has an accessible sound control. Hover or focus the sound button to expand the slider; tap/click to pin it open or close it. Escape or an outside tap closes it. Adjusting the slider is a user interaction that can enable audio. Content remains visible if JavaScript or media is unavailable.

## Design and motion

Frosted profile cards, white name glow, and restrained glass highlights share `styles.css`. Homepage entrance animations and 2.5-second floating phrases (0.5-second fade in, 1.5-second drift, 0.5-second fade out) respect reduced-motion preferences. Phrases are decorative, avoid the central controls, are limited to four on desktop and two on mobile, and stop spawning in hidden tabs.

Same-origin navigation uses native cross-document view transitions where available, with a short fade fallback for marked links. Modified clicks and external new-tab links keep standard browser behavior.

InternalCheats's bio links to Ascendo and javitointezet, and the GitHub row links to `https://github.com/internalcheat`; each opens a new tab.

## Assets and deployment

All original media remains in `assets/`. InternalCheats uses `assets/mypfp-animated.webp`, generated from all 113 original MP4 frames at 20 fps (5.65 seconds), with a still-poster source for reduced motion and an image-error fallback. k3rlsen uses a face-and-shoulders crop in `assets/k3rlsen-mbappe.webp`; the supplied original is preserved in `assets/k3rlsen-mbappe-original.png`. The Ascendo PNG/ICO favicons are derived from the supplied purple mark. The local white GitHub mark comes from [Primer Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons/blob/main/icons/mark-github-16.svg). The white Discord symbol in `assets/discord.svg` comes from [Discord's brand page](https://discord.com/branding), specifically [the white symbol asset](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6257adef93867e50d84d30e2/66e3d7f4ef6498ac018f2c55_Symbol.svg). `assets/minecraft-creeper.svg` is the recognizable pixel Creeper-face treatment used beside the Minecraft IGN.

Keep `CNAME` set to `ascendo.lol`. GitHub Pages deploys from `main`; verify the Pages workflow and live domain after merging. Version stylesheet/script references together when changing shared assets.

To add a curated profile, copy an existing profile directory, edit the identity, bio, links and canonical URL, then add its founder card to the homepage. No framework or package installation is needed.
